## 📖 Overview

This risk register portfolio showcases my ability to identify, assess, and communicate both **technical** and **business-level risks** in cybersecurity environments. 

It includes:
- Professionally documented risks
- Custom mitigation strategies
- Clear risk scores (Impact × Likelihood)
- Real-world analogies to make complex risks easier to understand and retain

Because cybersecurity isn’t just protection — it’s preservation.

This demonstrates my ability to balance technical detail with organizational impact.
